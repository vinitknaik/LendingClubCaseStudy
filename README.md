# Lending Club Case Study
> In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## Problem Statement
You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The data given for this case study contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Analysis Approach
- Data sourcing (Upgrad given loan.csv file)
- After data sourcing apply EDA concept and perform the required changes/cleanup on the received data.
- Then apply actual Data Analysis and Data Visualization concepts, which will helps to understand the trends.
- And, share the outcome.
